Endpoints

POST /api/auth/register --> registers a new user.
    Register requires a first_name, last_name, email, username, and password

POST /api/auth/login ---> login and receive token to access rest of API
    Login requires a username and password

ALL endpoints below this line require being logged in with a token stored to access - if this is annoying for development purposes I can turn it off

    need a way to invite/ uninvite a user to potluck INVITE is DONE / POST /api/potlucks/:id/guests ---> for the specified potluck, this will invite a user based on their username. Only need to pass in username property. I will probably only add an uninvite feature if we think that is important
